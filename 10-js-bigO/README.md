# Big O & Asymptotic Notation

### Learning Goals

## Objectives

- Understand asymptotic notation and its varied applications for calculating program runtime

## Deliverables

- Discuss:
  - Constant Time Complexity
  - Logarithmic Time Complexity
  - Linear Time Complexity
  - O(N logN) falls between Linear and Quadratic. This is the time complexity of JavaScript's built-in .sort() method.
  - Quadratic Time Complexity
